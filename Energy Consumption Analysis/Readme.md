# Energy Consumption Analysis

This project explores and analyzes **energy consumption patterns** to uncover inefficiencies and suggest optimization strategies. It was completed as part of the **USAID-funded Data Science Internship** at Carerha.

## 📌 Objective

The goal was to:
- Clean and process energy usage data
- Identify high and low-consumption zones or anomalies
- perform a simple staristical analysis
- Communicate insights with clear visuals and explanations

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Statistical Analysis**
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing value and anomalies
   - Normalized units and timestamps

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identified peak usage periods
   - Visualized patterns over time
   - Compared consumption between zones or departments

3. **Modeling**
   - Statistical analysis

4. **Recommendations**
   - Suggested actions for reducing waste
   - Highlighted times of unnecessary spikes
